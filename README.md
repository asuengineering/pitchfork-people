## Usage Requirements

- Download the lastest release from Github.
- Install in the normal WP location for plugins which is typically `/wp-content/plugins`.

**Recommended / Required Additional Plugins**

This plugin contains blocks that are constructed with the use of Advanced Custom Fields Pro.

- The ACF Pro plugin is also required by the Pitchfork theme.
- The Pitchfork theme contains a script which will prompt the user to install this plugin upon theme activation.
- ASU Engineering provides a licensed copy of this plugin within its standard distribution of WordPress.

Plugin updates can applied from the admin dashboard through the use of [WP Pusher](https://wppusher.com/) or [Git Updater](https://git-updater.com/).

## Configuration

This plugin provides one administration screen located at `/wp-admin/options-general.php?page=pfpeople_block_cache`. To access the configuration screen, users should have the `manage_options` capability that is normally assigned to the `administrator` role.

Configurable actions and options include:

- Setting the length of time that profile data is cached by the site. (Default setting is 30 days.)
- Clearing all cached data generated by this plugin for the site.
- Clearing data related to individual profiles as needed.

## Includes

- This plugin conditionally loads the [app-webdir-ui package](https://github.com/orgs/ASU/packages) from the Unity project as needed.
- All other styles are expected to be provided by the WordPress theme in use. (Which in turn would ideally load a copy of the `unity-bootstrap-theme` also found within the ASU package library).

## Development

- SASS and JS compile & watch tasks are triggered via [Gulp WP](https://github.com/cr0ybot/gulp-wp) and `npx gulp-wp` from the project root.

## Release Notes

See [CHANGELOG.md](CHANGELOG.md) for the a list of all improvements made to the plugin.
